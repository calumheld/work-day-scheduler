# work-day-scheduler
made an array that contained an object for every hour of the work day. each object had 3 pieces of info. The first was a string of the time in regular notation. This was what would be displayed on each row, as well as how i'd find the object in the array when it was time to save the info. second was the text that would be stored in the array. 3rd was an int value of the time which would be compared to the actual time value i'd get from the moment.js. I had a for loop make a new row for every hour in the array and compared the time integer to the current time and changed the textarea's class based on relation to the current time. I made the save button run findIndex of the value stored in the first part of the row and save the text content of the textarea to the text variable in the object, then would save the object to local storage. Finally i went back and made an if statement for if there was an object in local storage and would initialize the array as the stored object on startup, otherwise the array created itself as normal. at one point I didnt know what findIndex was and googling how to search for a specific object value was getting me nowhere, so i made a seperate array of times with the same index values as the objects in the main array, then just used the index of the time i wanted in one array to reference the thing i wanted in the object array. It's the dumbest thing i've ever coded and im glad i didnt have to keep it.
